I created a basic recipe website using html with a home page consisting of 3 recipes for potatoes, chicken and carrots. I created an images folder where all my media is stored, a recipe folder where all my recipe html code is written, and my index. html code that ensures my website can be recognized properly by web browsers alongside this explanatory page!
